My primary interest is in developing a generic model for knowledge representation. These models, called ontologies, are highly formal and developed in the language of category theory. Although category theory is said to be "highly abstract" and "inaccessible" to non-mathematicians, these same people seem to have an intuitive understanding of informally "breaking down" concepts into subconcepts. This is the idea of hierarchical ontology, the mathematics behind it are highly formal and written entirely in category theory, yet the end goal of breaking down ideas is something humans do every day.

Following this realization, I set out to create a user-friendly* graphical interface for creating hierarchical ontologies, specifically hierarchical graphs. This follows the formal work I have done in defining submorphisms, which you can see in my [talks](./Talks.html).

This program is experimental, and has the capability of executing files on your computer  
(only if you tell it to, and it will ask you first).   

This is far from user-friendly in it's current state, but it is a start.
