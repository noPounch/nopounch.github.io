My primary interest is in developing a generic model for knowledge representation. These models, called ontologies, are highly formal and developed in the language of category theory, which is seem as highly abstract and "inaccessible" to non-mathematicians. Yet, surprisingly, what I've found is that the creation of ontologies (and the upgrade to hierarchical ontologies) to represent thought is intuitive to most non-mathematicians (I'm great at parties)  

Following this realization, I set out to create a user-friendly* graphical interface for creating hierarchical ontologies, specifically hierarchical graphs. This follows the formal work I have done in defining submorphisms, which you can see in my [talks](./Talks.html).
