Hello!  

##### Who I am:  
I am a 3rd year PhD student and the University of Maryland.  

##### What I do:
- I use category theory to create models for data representation, called "Ontologies".
- I (try to) create user friendly interfaces for creating ontologies
- I host an Applied Category Theory group at UMD [mdcats](https://mdcats.github.io)

##### My hopes and dreams:  
The "Applied Category Theory" movement is relatively new and it has JUST branched out of mathematics to other sciences and engineering. My hope is that we can create a conceptual representation paradigm in category theory, with tools accessible enough for all humans to reason and communicate with. I think this can be done with a good notion of ontology, and I dream of ontological representations of poetry, art, games, music, and of course mathematics.


##### Besides math:
- I am in love with Existentialism: as an atheist, it is my best defense against nihilism. My favorite Authors include Sartre and Camus, to poets like George Russel Williams.  
- I'm a big fan of rock, jazz, and rap. My all time favorites include Hiromi Uehara, and Kendrick Lamar
- I love to hike

##### A little History:
- I grew up on Long Island, in high school I was interested in Robotics and Physics
- I attended the University of Rochester, majoring in Physics and Math
